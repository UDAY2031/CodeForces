# A. Watermelon — Codeforces Problem(4A)

This repository contains a simple explanation and reference solution outline for the Codeforces problem **A. Watermelon**.

---

## 🧩 Problem Statement

Pete and Billy bought a watermelon weighing **w** kilos.  
They want to divide it into **two parts**, such that:

- Each part weighs an **even** number of kilos.
- Each part has **positive** weight.
- The parts **do not have to be equal**.

Your task is to determine if such a split is possible.

## 📥 Input

A single integer:

- `w` — watermelon weight  
  - Constraint: `1 ≤ w ≤ 100`

## 📥 Input

A single integer:

- `w` — watermelon weight  
  - Constraint: `1 ≤ w ≤ 100`

Example:
8

## 📤 Output

Print:

- `YES` — if the watermelon can be split into two even positive parts.
- `NO` — otherwise.

Example:
YES


---

## 🔍 Logic

To split `w` into two **positive even** integers:

- The total weight `w` must be **even**.
- `w` must be **greater than 2** (since the smallest even positive number is 2).

Therefore, the condition:

`If w is even AND w > 2 → YES
Else → NO`
